# Captions

Stash supports captioning with DE, EN, ES, FR, IT, NL, and PT VTT files.

In order for Stash to find these files they must exist in the same directory as the matching video file and must have the same base name. For example, a EN file for `video.mp4` must be named `video.en.vtt`. A scan must be run to update scenes with matching captions.

Scenes with captions can be filtered with the `captioned` criterion.
